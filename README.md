# SCART Composite Sync Splitter/Cleaner

## Introduction

This card takes an RGB + Composite signal from a SCART connector and outputs the same RGB signal + split HSync/VSync (or CSync) on an 
HD15 (VGA) connector. This is **not** a scandoubler, and is meant to be used with multisync monitors that require either separated
sync signals or a clean csync.

The board is based around the LMH1981 IC and takes from 7 to 12VDC, center tip positive, as power input.

⚠️⚠️⚠️ ***THIS BOARD IS STILL IN PROTOTYPING STAGE AND CURRENTLY UNTESTED*** ⚠️⚠️⚠️

I take NO responsibility for what happens if you decide to build and use this card. Your computer might crash, catch fire or be destroyed in other nasty ways.
